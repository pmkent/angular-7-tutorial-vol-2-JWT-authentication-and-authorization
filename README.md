This is the second in our series of tutorials that are meant for the novice developer as Angular 7 tutorials for beginners. For advanced Angular 7 developers stuck with a development issue in a project this could come in handy especially if you are tasked with providing security for an existing web application.

This implements ANGULAR 7 VALIDATION AND AUTHORIZATION using industry standard JWT tokens.

The code uses Angular Material Design to build a login form with
-A regular username text field
-A password field with masked characters

Among Angular Material components is mat-icons used in fields, Angular Material Buttons showing you how to make them enabled or disabled based on form validation status.

We'll show how how to user the Angular guard to protect pages and restrict them to authorized users only.
